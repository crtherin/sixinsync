Her golden hair falls around her like a soft halo, framing a face that’s impossibly beautiful, lips slightly parted, as though she’s about to say something that could make your heart race. She moves with such grace, every step deliberate, teasing, like she knows you’re watching—and she likes it. There’s an effortless confidence in the way she holds herself, as if the world bends around her beauty, and you can’t help but feel drawn in. When her gaze meets yours, it’s like she’s daring you to surrender to the heat between you, and you’re not sure if you want to resist or give in completely.",
